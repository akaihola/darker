# Below are the regular expression patterns for finding and replacing version and
# milestone numbers in files. Keys are file paths relative to the repository root.
# Values are sets of regular expression pattern strings which contain a magic
# `{OLD->NEW}` expression. For matching text, that expression will be turned into a
# regular expression string which matches the expected version or milestone string in
# the current content of a file. For replacing those matches with updated information,
# `NEW` specifies which kind of a version or milestone number should be used as the
# replacement.
#
# For example, if the current version ("old_version") was `1.0.1` and bumping the minor
# version was requested, the entry
#
#   "README.rst":
#   - |-
#     next version: {old_version->new_version}
#
# would use this regular expression:
#
#   `r"next version: (1\.0\.1)"`
#
# in `README.rst` and replace the text matched by the capture group with "1.1".
