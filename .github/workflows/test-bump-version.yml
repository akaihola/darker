        # If this fails, make sure the regular expressions in `bump_version.py`
        # match changes in the files to modify. Also ensure there's a milestone
        # in https://github.com/akaihola/darker/milestones with a future
        # version number as its name. This is used to update the call for
        # reviewing pull requests in `README.rst`.
