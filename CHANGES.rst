Unreleased_
===========

These features will be included in the next release:

Added
-----
- Configure Flake8 verification for Darker source code
- Configuration for Darker can now be done in ``pyproject.toml``.
- The formatting of the Darker code base itself is now checked using Darker itself and
  pytest-darker_. Currently the formatting is a mix of `Black 19.10`_ and `Black 20.8`_
  rules, and Travis CI only requires Black 20.8 formatting for lines modified in merge
  requests. In a way, Darker is now eating its own dogfood.

Fixed
-----


1.1.0_ - 2020-08-15
===================

Added
-----
- ``-L``/``--lint`` option for running a linter for modified lines.
- ``--check`` returns ``1`` from the process but leaves files untouched if any file
  would require reformatting
- Untracked Python files – e.g. those added recently – are now also reformatted
- ``-r <rev>`` / ``--revision <rev>`` can be used to specify the Git revision to compare
  against when finding out modified lines. Defaults to ``HEAD`` as before.
- ``--no-skip-string-normalization`` flag to override
  ``skip_string_normalization = true`` from a configuration file
- The ``--diff`` option will highlight syntax on screen if the ``pygments`` package is
  available.

Fixed
-----
- Paths from ``--diff`` are now relative to current working directory, similar to output
  from ``black --diff``, and blank lines after the lines markers (``@@ ... @@``) have
  been removed.


1.0.0_ - 2020-07-15
===================

Added
-----
- Support for black config
- Support for ``-l``/``--line-length`` and ``-S``/``--skip-string-normalization``
- ``--diff`` outputs a diff for each file on standard output
- Require ``isort`` >= 5.0.1 and be compatible with it
- Allow to configure ``isort`` through ``pyproject.toml``


0.2.0_ - 2020-03-11
===================

Added
-----
- Retry with a larger ``git diff -U<context_lines>`` option after producing a
  re-formatted Python file which fails to result in an identical AST

Fixed
-----
- Run `isort` first, and only then do the detailed ``git diff`` for Black


0.1.1_ - 2020-02-17
===================

Fixed
-----
- logic for choosing original/formatted chunks


0.1.0_ - 2020-02-17
===================

Added
-----
- Initial implementation
