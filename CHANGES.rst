Unreleased_
===========

These features will be included in the next release:

Added
-----
- Support for Black's ``--skip-magic-trailing-comma`` option
- ``darker --diff`` output is now identical to that of ``black --diff``
- The ``-d`` / ``--stdout`` option outputs the reformatted contents of the single Python
  file provided on the command line.
- Terminate with an error if non-existing files or directories are passed on the command
  line. This also improves the error from misquoted parameters like ``"--lint pylint"``.
- Allow Git test case to run slower when checking file timestamps. CI can be slow.
- Fix compatibility with Black >= 21.7b1.dev9

Fixed
-----
- Ensure a full revision range ``--revision <COMMIT_A>..<COMMIT_B>`` where
  COMMIT_B is *not* ``:WORKTREE:`` works too.
- Hide fatal error from Git on stderr when ``git show`` doesn't find the file in rev1.
  This isn't fatal from Darker's point of view since it's a newly created file.
- Use forward slash as the path separator when calling Git in Windows. At least
  ``git show`` and ``git cat-file`` fail when using backslashes.


1.2.4_ - 2021-06-27
===================

Added
-----
- Upgrade to and satisfy MyPy 0.910 by adding ``types-toml`` as a test dependency, and
  ``types-dataclasses`` as well if running on Python 3.6.
- Installation instructions in a Conda environment.

Fixed
-----
- Git-related commands in the test suite now ignore the user's ``~/.gitconfig``.
- Now works again even if ``isort`` isn't installed
- AST verification no longer erroneously fails when using ``--isort``
- Historical comparisons like ``darker --diff --revision=v1.0..v1.1`` now actually
  compare the second revision and not the working tree files on disk.
- Ensure identical Black formatting on Unix and Windows by always passing Unix newlines
  to Black


1.2.3_ - 2021-05-02
===================

Added
-----
- A unified ``TextDocument`` class to represent source code file contents
- Move help texts into the separate ``darker.help`` module
- If AST differs with zero context lines, search for the lowest successful number of
  context lines using a binary search to improve performance
- Return an exit value of 1 also if there are failures from any of the linters on
  modified lines
- Run GitHub Actions for the test build also on Windows and macOS

Fixed
-----
- Compatibility with MyPy 0.812
- Keep newline character sequence and text encoding intact when modifying files
- Installation now works on Windows
- Improve compatibility with pre-commit. Fallback to compare against HEAD if
  ``--revision :PRE-COMMIT:`` is set, but ``PRE_COMMIT_FROM_REF`` or
  ``PRE_COMMIT_TO_REF`` are not set.


1.2.2_ - 2020-12-30
===================

Added
-----
- Get revision range from pre-commit_'s ``PRE_COMMIT_FROM_REF`` and
  ``PRE_COMMIT_TO_REF`` environment variables when using the ``--revision :PRE-COMMIT:``
  option
- Configure a pre-commit hook for Darker itself
- Add a Darker package to conda-forge_.

Fixed
-----
- ``<commit>...`` now compares always correctly to the latest common ancestor
- Migrate from Travis CI to GitHub Actions


1.2.1_ - 2020-11-30
===================

Added
-----
- Travis CI now runs Pylint_ on modified lines via pytest-darker_
- Darker can now be used as a pre-commit hook (see pre-commit_)
- Document integration with Vim
- Thank all contributors right in the ``README``
- ``RevisionRange`` class and Git repository test fixture improvements in preparation
  for a larger refactoring coming in `#80`_

Fixed
-----
- Improve example in ``README`` and clarify that path argument can also be a directory


1.2.0_ - 2020-09-09
===================

Added
-----
- Configuration for Darker can now be done in ``pyproject.toml``.
- The formatting of the Darker code base itself is now checked using Darker itself and
  pytest-darker_. Currently the formatting is a mix of `Black 19.10`_ and `Black 20.8`_
  rules, and Travis CI only requires Black 20.8 formatting for lines modified in merge
  requests. In a way, Darker is now eating its own dogfood.
- Support commit ranges for ``-r``/``--revision``. Useful for comparing to the best
  common ancestor, e.g. ``master...``.
- Configure Flake8 verification for Darker's own source code


1.1.0_ - 2020-08-15
===================

Added
-----
- ``-L``/``--lint`` option for running a linter for modified lines.
- ``--check`` returns ``1`` from the process but leaves files untouched if any file
  would require reformatting
- Untracked Python files – e.g. those added recently – are now also reformatted
- ``-r <rev>`` / ``--revision <rev>`` can be used to specify the Git revision to compare
  against when finding out modified lines. Defaults to ``HEAD`` as before.
- ``--no-skip-string-normalization`` flag to override
  ``skip_string_normalization = true`` from a configuration file
- The ``--diff`` option will highlight syntax on screen if the ``pygments`` package is
  available.

Fixed
-----
- Paths from ``--diff`` are now relative to current working directory, similar to output
  from ``black --diff``, and blank lines after the lines markers (``@@ ... @@``) have
  been removed.


1.0.0_ - 2020-07-15
===================

Added
-----
- Support for black config
- Support for ``-l``/``--line-length`` and ``-S``/``--skip-string-normalization``
- ``--diff`` outputs a diff for each file on standard output
- Require ``isort`` >= 5.0.1 and be compatible with it
- Allow to configure ``isort`` through ``pyproject.toml``


0.2.0_ - 2020-03-11
===================

Added
-----
- Retry with a larger ``git diff -U<context_lines>`` option after producing a
  re-formatted Python file which fails to result in an identical AST

Fixed
-----
- Run `isort` first, and only then do the detailed ``git diff`` for Black


0.1.1_ - 2020-02-17
===================

Fixed
-----
- logic for choosing original/formatted chunks


0.1.0_ - 2020-02-17
===================

Added
-----
- Initial implementation
