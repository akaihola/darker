What?
=====

This is a small utility built on top of the black_ and isort_ Python code formatters
to enable formatting of only regions which have changed in the Git working tree
since the last commit.

.. _black: https://github.com/python/black
.. _isort: https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort

Why?
====

You want to start unifying code style in your project using black_.
But instead of formatting the whole code base in one giant commit,
you'd like to only change formatting when you're touching the code for other reasons.

This can also be useful
when contributing to upstream codebases that are not under your complete control.

However, partial formatting is not supported by black_ itself,
for various good reasons, and it won't be implemented either
(`134`__, `142`__, `245`__, `370`__, `511`__, `830`__).

__ https://github.com/python/black/issues/134
__ https://github.com/python/black/issues/142
__ https://github.com/python/black/issues/245
__ https://github.com/python/black/issues/370
__ https://github.com/python/black/issues/511
__ https://github.com/python/black/issues/830

This is where ``darker`` enters the stage.
This tool is for those who want to do partial formatting anyway.

Note that this tool is meant for special situations
when dealing with existing code bases.
You should just use black_ as is when starting a project from scratch.

How?
====

To install, use::

  pip install darker

The ``darker <myfile.py>`` command
reads the original file,
formats it using black_,
combines original and formatted regions based on edits,
and writes back over the original file.

Alternatively, you can invoke the module directly through the ``python`` executable,
which may be preferable depending on your setup.
Use ``python -m darker`` instead of ``darker`` in that case.

Example:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ mkdir test && cd test && git init
   Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/test/.git/
   $ echo "if True: print('hi')\n\nif False: print('there')" | tee test.py
   if True: print('hi')

   if False: print('there')
   $ git add test.py && git commit -m "Initial commit"
   [master (root-commit) a0c7c32] Initial commit
    1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
    create mode 100644 test.py
   $ echo "if True: print('changed')\n\nif False: print('there')" | tee test.py
   if True: print('changed')

   if False: print('there')
   $ darker test.py && cat test.py
   if True:
       print("changed")

   if False: print('there')

Customizing Black and isort behavior
====================================

Project-specific default options for Black_ and isort_
are read from the project's ``pyproject.toml`` file in the repository root.
isort_ also looks for a few other places for configuration.

For more details, see:

- `Black documentation about pyproject.toml`_
- `isort documentation about config files`_

The following `command line arguments`_ can also be used to modify the defaults:

.. code-block:: shell

     --check               Don't write the files back, just return the status.
                           Return code 0 means nothing would change. Return code
                           1 means some files would be reformatted.
     -c PATH, --config PATH
                           Ask `black` and `isort` to read configuration from PATH.
     -S, --skip-string-normalization
                           Don't normalize string quotes or prefixes
     -l LINE_LENGTH, --line-length LINE_LENGTH
                           How many characters per line to allow [default: 88]

*New in version 1.0.0:* The ``-c``, ``-S`` and ``-l`` command line options.

*New in version 1.0.0:* isort_ is configured with ``-c`` and ``-l``, too.

*New in version 1.1.0:* The ``--check`` command line option.

Editor integration
==================

Many editors have plugins or recipes for integrating black_.
You may be able to adapt them to be used with ``darker``.
See `editor integration`__ in the black_ documentation.

PyCharm/IntelliJ IDEA
---------------------

1. Install ``darker``::

     $ pip install darker

2. Locate your ``darker`` installation folder.

   On macOS / Linux / BSD::

     $ which darker
     /usr/local/bin/darker  # possible location

   On Windows::

     $ where darker
     %LocalAppData%\Programs\Python\Python36-32\Scripts\darker.exe  # possible location

3. Open External tools in PyCharm/IntelliJ IDEA

   On macOS:

   ``PyCharm -> Preferences -> Tools -> External Tools``

   On Windows / Linux / BSD:

   ``File -> Settings -> Tools -> External Tools``

4. Click the ``+`` icon to add a new external tool with the following values:

   - Name: Darker
   - Description: Use Black to auto-format regions changed since the last git commit.
   - Program: <install_location_from_step_2>
   - Arguments: ``"$FilePath$"``

   If you need any extra command line arguments
   like the ones which change Black behavior,
   you can add them to the ``Arguments`` field, e.g.::

       --config /home/myself/black.cfg "$FilePath$"

5. Format the currently opened file by selecting ``Tools -> External Tools -> Darker``.

   - Alternatively, you can set a keyboard shortcut by navigating to
     ``Preferences or Settings -> Keymap -> External Tools -> External Tools - Darker``

6. Optionally, run ``darker`` on every file save:

   1. Make sure you have the `File Watcher`__ plugin installed.
   2. Go to ``Preferences or Settings -> Tools -> File Watchers`` and click ``+`` to add
      a new watcher:

      - Name: Darker
      - File type: Python
      - Scope: Project Files
      - Program: <install_location_from_step_2>
      - Arguments: ``$FilePath$``
      - Output paths to refresh: ``$FilePath$``
      - Working directory: ``$ProjectFileDir$``

   3. Uncheck "Auto-save edited files to trigger the watcher"

Visual Studio Code
------------------

1. Install ``darker``::

     $ pip install darker

2. Locate your ``darker`` installation folder.

   On macOS / Linux / BSD::

     $ which darker
     /usr/local/bin/darker  # possible location

   On Windows::

     $ where darker
     %LocalAppData%\Programs\Python\Python36-32\Scripts\darker.exe  # possible location

3. Add these configuration options::

    "python.formatting.provider": "black",
    "python.formatting.blackPath": "<install_location_from_step_2>"


How does it work?
=================

Darker takes a ``git diff`` of your Python files,
records which lines of current files have been edited or added since the last commit.
It then runs black_ and notes which chunks of lines were reformatted.
Finally, only those reformatted chunks on which edited lines fall (even partially)
are applied to the edited file.

Also, in case the ``--isort`` option was specified,
isort_ is run on each edited file before applying black_.
