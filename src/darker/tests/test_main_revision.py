# The following test is a bit dense, so some explanation is due.
#
# A Git repository with 3 commits is created. Python files with one line of code
# ("ORIGINAL=1") are added, modified or deleted in each commit. An abbreviated number is
# used for each commit in the test code:
# - 2: HEAD~2          add 4 files
# - 1: HEAD~1 (HEAD^)  add 2 files, delete 1 file, keep 1 file, modify 2 files
# - 0: HEAD~0 (HEAD)   delete 1 file, modify 1 file, keep 4 files
#
# In each test case, all of the 6 files are overwritten in the working tree with given
# content.
#
# `darker --diff --revision <rev>` is called and the diff captured from stdout.
#
# Each case is gets as parameters:
# - the `<rev>` argument – which Git revision to compare to
# - `worktree_content` – the content to write to all the 6 known Python files
# - `expect` – a list of files expected to appear in `darker --diff`
#
# The Python file names tell the history of the file with a list of actions:
# +2 - added in HEAD~2
# +1 - added in HEAD^
# -1 - deleted in HEAD^
# M1 - modified in HEAD^
# -0 - deleted in HEAD
# M0 - modified in HEAD
#
# So e.g. the test case `HEAD~2`, `ORIGINAL=1` tells us that when `ORIGINAL=1` is
# written to all Python files and `darker --diff --revision HEAD~2` is called, the diff
# indicates reformatting in
# - +1.py – the file which was added in HEAD^
# - +1M0.py – the file added in HEAD^ and overwritten in HEAD (with `MODIFIED=1`)
# All other files are missing from the diff since their content was the same as now
# (`ORIGINAL=1`) at HEAD~2.
