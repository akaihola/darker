"""Run arbitrary linters on given files in a Git repository

This supports any linter which reports on standard output and has a fairly standard
correct output format::

    <path>:<linenum>: <description>
    <path>:<linenum>:<column>: <description>

For example, Mypy outputs::

    module.py:57: error: Function is missing a type annotation for one or more arguments

Pylint, on the other hand::

    module.py:44:8: R1720: Unnecessary "elif" after "raise" (no-else-raise)

All such output from the linter will be printed on the standard output
provided that the ``<linenum>`` falls on a changed line.
