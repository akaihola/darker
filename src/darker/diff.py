"""Diff text and get line numbers of changes or chunks of original and changed content

The functions in this module implement

- diffing text files, returning opcodes
- turning opcodes into a list of line numbers of changed lines
- turning opcodes into chunks of original and modified text

In our case, we run a diff between original and user-edited source code.
Another diff is done between user-edited and Black-reformatted source code
as returned by :func:`black.black_diff.run_black_for_content`.

    >>> src = TextDocument.from_lines(
    ...     [
    ...         'for i in range(5): print(i)',
    ...         'print("done")'
    ...     ]
    ... )

    >>> dst = TextDocument.from_lines(
    ...     [
    ...         'for i in range(5):',
    ...         '    print(i)',
    ...         'print("done")'
    ...     ]
    ... )

:func:`diff_and_get_opcodes`.
divides a diff between the original and reformatted content
into alternating chunks of
intact (represented by the 'equal' tag) and
modified ('delete', 'replace' or 'insert' tag) lines.
Each chunk is an opcode represented by the tag and the corresponding 0-based line ranges
in the original and reformatted content, e.g.::

    >>> opcodes = diff_and_get_opcodes(src, dst)
    >>> len(opcodes)
    2
    >>> opcodes[0]  # split 'for' loop into two lines
    ('replace', 0, 1, 0, 2)
    >>> opcodes[1]  # keep 'print("done")' as such
    ('equal', 1, 2, 2, 3)

:func:`opcodes_to_chunks` picks the lines
from original and reformatted content for each opcode.
It combines line content with the 1-based line offset in the original content, e.g.::

    >>> chunks = list(opcodes_to_chunks(opcodes, src, dst))
    >>> len(chunks)
    2
    >>> chunks[0]  # (<offset in orig content>, <original lines>, <reformatted lines>)
    (1, ('for i in range(5): print(i)',), ('for i in range(5):', '    print(i)'))
    >>> chunks[1]
    (2, ('print("done")',), ('print("done")',))

By concatenating the second items in these tuples, i.e. original lines,
the original file can be reconstructed.

By concatenating the third items, i.e. reformatted lines,
the complete output from Black can be reconstructed.

By concatenating and choosing either the second or third item,
a mixed result with only selected regions reformatted can be reconstructed.
